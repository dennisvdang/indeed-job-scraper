SUMMARY OF POSITION

The Funding Desk Operations Analyst will demonstrate expertise on reporting databases, Sharepoint document management and applications for Funding Desk activities, perform research and analysis, and produce reports that measure the effectiveness of Funding Desk and Office of Finance funding efforts.
