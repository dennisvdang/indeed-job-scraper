We have opportunities to join us for several days of delivery work and while this is a temporary position, most of the regular delivery drivers that we work with started out on a holiday.

Fun, enjoyable work because everyone LOVES receiving flowers!

The special pay rate for the holiday is $25 per hour. Drivers for the holiday work as independent contractors so you can set your schedule and work as many or as few hours as you like. Drivers use their own car to make deliveries on organized routes all around the greater LA area and can drive as many as 80-100 miles a day if you do a full day.

This work is best for people who are savvy at parking, keen at navigation, and who have an economical car. The hours and days always fit within your availability so this could work well while doing another job. We have morning, afternoon or double shifts available each day.

Looking for people who are definitely available all day on Sunday May 11 for Mother's Day. We’ll have work for you on the days leading up to that day as well but you must have open availability on the 11th for this to work, as that’s the day we’re all gearing up for with each day coming up to it.

Once you apply, we’ll reach out to you by phone to get you more and invite you to come out to our orientation. The orientation is a paid training where you get to do a few deliveries to try out the work and make sure it’s for you.

We have 3 store locations. Our main store is in the Pico/Robertson area of Los Angeles, and we have two smaller locations in Costa Mesa and Westlake Village so feel free to apply if you’re closer to one of those locations as well, because we’ll need some people for each store, but the most work by far will be available in the city of Los Angeles.

We’ll be calling people back starting Monday, April 28, and onboarding this week, so apply soon to be sure you’re on the top of the list!
