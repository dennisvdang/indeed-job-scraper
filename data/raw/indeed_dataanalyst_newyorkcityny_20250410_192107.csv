Organization Overview: 

The Fortune Society, Inc. (Fortune) has been working for over 57 years in service to our mission: to support successful reentry from incarceration and promote alternatives to incarceration, thus strengthening the fabric of our communities. The organization has evolved into one of the nation’s preeminent reentry and justice-informed service organizations, providing formerly incarcerated people with the skills and wrap-around services needed to break the cycle of crime and incarceration and to build productive lives in their communities.

Fortune has grown steadily over the years to an agency just under $79 million in annual budget with just under 600 staff. We anticipate that we will keep growing, both in size and in depth of service. Fortune has a dual mission: both advocacy and service. The advocacy portion of our mission focuses on building a more just criminal legal system and reducing the barriers to reentry into society. The service side of Fortune has evolved to encompass a broad range of programs that started with employment and education and now includes a robust array of services, among them: alternatives to incarceration, supervised release, court advocacy, discharge planning within correctional facilities, licensed substance use and mental health treatment, a housing continuum ranging from emergency and transitional through permanent congregate and scattered site housing, assistance in obtaining benefits, a care management unit, HIV services, a food and nutrition program, and an arts program.

Mammoth Brands (formerly Harry's Inc.) is the modern CPG company behind brands Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, and Mando. We're building a new model—and home—brands, founders, and talent looking to solve unmet needs, improve peoples' lives, and ultimately challenge the status quo. Our mission is to ""Create Things People Like More."" Simply put: everything we do should be better than what already exists. If it's not, we don't do it. This guides everything we do, from developing the best product experiences, to making Mammoth Brands a great place to work, to exploring innovative ways to give back to our community.

We got our start in 2013 when our co-founders created Harry's. We built the brand differently—online first, prioritizing direct relationships with customers—and in the process learned they'd created something bigger: a playbook and platform that could help other brands grow and scale to their full potential, and a vision to reimagine consumer packaged goods. Today, Mammoth Brands is a growing portfolio of brands and the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years. Even as we grow, we take extra care to maintain the small, scrappy, entrepreneurial culture that helped to get us where we are today: to create a company that people like more, that better serves its customers, employees, and community. As a company, we're also committed to making a positive impact and have donated over $20 million through our network of nonprofit partners to date.
