Our vision is to create a new industrial supply chain to unblock critical hardware innovation across sectors and industries.

We are seeking an Assembly Technician to join a nimble, fast-paced team at the front lines of our factory, building and testing industrial control panels. You will have the opportunity to work in a variety of different operations from enclosure modification through wiring through final testing. As Podium iterates and implements new technologies, you will work hand-in-hand with the engineering team to both operate and test the new methods and equipment, while providing feedback and suggestions to help continually improve our production process.

What You’ll Do

  • Modify enclosures to include cutouts for panel mounted devices.
  • Drill and tap panel backplanes per drawings provided by the engineering team
  • Retrieve components from stockroom and help maintain stockroom inventory levels
  • Mount components to the panel and wire them together
  • Complete inspection procedures to ensure panels were assembled correctly
  • Assist with preparing completed panels for shipping, and helping load/unload goods from trucks when needed.
  • Test new methods and operate prototype automated equipment to help improve the speed and quality of the panels Podium builds, and provide constructive and detailed feedback.

Who You Are

There are 4 values that all Podium employees are expected to demonstrate (albeit imperfectly):

  • Customer Obsession: We sit on the same side of the table as our customers and build things to solve their biggest problems
  • High Integrity: We strive to be honest, transparent, and kind. We do the right thing even when it's not the easy or obvious path, and believe that how things get done is just as important as what gets done.
  • Have Grit: We pick up the broom and have a bias for action. We enjoy doing things outside of our comfort zone, and we roll up our sleeves and take on those challenges head-on.
  • Win and Lose as a Team: We work collaboratively and take primary fulfillment from the team’s success. While we certainly celebrate individual achievements, we ultimately win as a team.

Required for this role

  • High school diploma or equivalent
  • Mechanically inclined and experience doing light sheet metal modification work (drilling and tapping holes, knockouts for conduits, cutting openings for panel mounted devices)
  • Attention to detail in following written instructions
  • Understanding of electrical fundamentals (AC vs DC voltage, function of overcurrent protection devices, sizing of wiring)
  • Proficient in Microsoft Office
  • Able to work on your feet 8 hours/day
  • Able to lift items that are 25 lbs
  • Available to work in-person in Brooklyn, NY Monday through Friday.

  • Experience working in a UL 508A panel shop or with industrial control panels
  • Familiar with DTM, E3, EPLAN, or AutoCAD Electrical
