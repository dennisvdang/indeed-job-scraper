We want to make a difference in the lives of those falling between the cracks of the current healthcare system, and could use all the help we can get reimagining last-mile healthcare delivery. 

*If you want to tackle tough questions with data*, we want to talk to you. Health tech is challenging enough on its own, but add in DoorDash-style logistics problems at scale and the constraints of a distributed labor force working in patients’ homes, and things get interesting quickly. We need someone to help answer the hard questions like: 

  •   
️ How can we better balance clinician availability and engagement capacity with patient demand in each region?

What influences a patient's receptiveness to outreach for preventive services? 

Where do our clinician routing simulations differ from real historical data? 

How can we reduce last-minute cancellations and reschedules? 

How could we use a patient's health data to predict future needs and risks? 

If any of these sound interesting, Sprinter could be the right place for you. This is your chance to build something truly 0 to 1 at a company with meteoric growth. 

Since just 2021, we've grown to: 

>50k patients served

6x revenue growth last year, 5x the year before 

>60% coverage of the US population 

6 of the 10 largest US health plans 

>$70M raised from a16z, General Catalyst, GV, and Accel 

*If you want to grow faster than you ever could at a big company*, we want to talk to you. If you're a fellow industry veteran looking to get in at the ground floor of something big, taking on radically larger scope and growing with the company, the best way to do so is with real responsibility to make real decisions, and as one of the first hires in Sprinter's Data org, you'll have that, working alongside engineers and product managers from the likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon. With industry-leading growth to date and plenty of room still to grow, getting in now is a recipe for success. 

*If you want to make a difference*, we want to talk to you. Jeffrey Hammerbacher was right: ""The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks."" I've done the Google and Facebook thing for a decade. Was it personally rewarding? Absolutely. But now I want to do something more directly for others, which is why I started this company. 

If any of this sounds like something you'd want to be a part of, just let me know. I'd really love to chat.
