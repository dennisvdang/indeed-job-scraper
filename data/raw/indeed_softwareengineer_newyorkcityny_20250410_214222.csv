Mammoth Brands (formerly Harry's Inc.) is the modern CPG company behind brands Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, and Mando. We're building a new model—and home—brands, founders, and talent looking to solve unmet needs, improve peoples' lives, and ultimately challenge the status quo. Our mission is to ""Create Things People Like More."" Simply put: everything we do should be better than what already exists. If it's not, we don't do it. This guides everything we do, from developing the best product experiences, to making Mammoth Brands a great place to work, to exploring innovative ways to give back to our community.

We got our start in 2013 when our co-founders created Harry's. We built the brand differently—online first, prioritizing direct relationships with customers—and in the process learned they'd created something bigger: a playbook and platform that could help other brands grow and scale to their full potential, and a vision to reimagine consumer packaged goods. Today, Mammoth Brands is a growing portfolio of brands and the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years. Even as we grow, we take extra care to maintain the small, scrappy, entrepreneurial culture that helped to get us where we are today: to create a company that people like more, that better serves its customers, employees, and community. As a company, we're also committed to making a positive impact and have donated over $20 million through our network of nonprofit partners to date.

At Candid Health, we're on a mission to revolutionize healthcare by solving one of its most complex and costly problems: the billing and revenue cycle management (RCM) process. The healthcare system has long been burdened by slow, inefficient workflows that waste valuable resources, leaving providers with less time and money to focus on patient care. With our cutting-edge revenue cycle automation platform, we are transforming this space through an intelligent, data-driven approach that simplifies billing, enhances claims processing, and eliminates administrative waste.

#  The Role

As a Principal Engineer at Candid Health, you’ll play a pivotal role in our mission to revolutionize healthcare billing by guiding the technical direction of the company. As one of our most senior engineering leaders at Candid, the ideal candidate needs to have a blend of excellent technical judgment and deep engineering knowledge (in terms of both breadth and depth); we’re looking for an architect and hands-on builder who knows how to build hard things at scale and deliver massive business impact by finding the simplest solutions to our most challenging business problems.

The right candidate is also a visionary and business leader. Our archetype for a Principal Engineer at Candid is someone who understands the domain and technology so well that they can identify blind spots and therefore see huge business opportunities that others either haven’t noticed or think are too difficult to achieve. You’ll be asked to dive deep into a highly complex & nuanced problem space (medical billing), venture beyond what’s conventionally been done, and think big about how we can pioneer new approaches to improve & reinvent old systems – with the customer constantly top of mind.

Last, but certainly not least, a core function of your role will be to mentor, develop, and grow the team around you. Although this isn’t a “people manager” position per se, you will be looked up to as a technical leader, educator, evangelist, role model, and engineering culture-setter. You should inspire and empower the team to do their best work: finding scalable ways to share your knowledge and expertise across the organization, helping to clear obstacles that hinder developer productivity, and broadly maximizing the impact of our technical teams by accelerating engineering velocity and improving the quality of our eng team.

#  What You’ll Do

  • Shape Technical Direction & Business Goals: Influence technical vision and architecture of the product. Act as a technical advisor to executive leadership and cross-functional teams, influencing business strategy and product roadmap.
