You can choose to be just a follower in the biggest wave of technological transformation AI has brought to human history—or you can join us.

We’re defining a new category—something that’s never existed or that others don’t dare to imagine. The journey will be intense and uncertain, but we won’t back down. We’re driven by our mission: to put the best AI tools in the hands of hardware engineers today and to push the boundaries of what AI can do for hardware design tomorrow.

Join our small, focused team. Grow fast. Ship meaningful code.

About Us

Our team comes from Stanford, CMU, Meta, and pioneering hardware and AI companies, bringing the top-tier expertise at the intersection of hardware and AI. Our investors include Khosla Ventures, Susa Ventures, and leaders in hardware engineering. Industry leaders and cutting-edge startups are already using our tools to ship products faster.

About the Role

As an early engineer at Converge Lab, you’ll play a key role in building the foundation of our product and company. This is a high-ownership, high-impact role - you’ll work directly with the founders and have a front-row seat to how the next generation of hardware design AI gets built.

In this role, you will:

  • Ship tons of code to production from day 1
  • Build and own key parts of the backend powering our transformative AI
  • Bring LLM-powered features to life and integrate them into real-world workflows
  • Solve hard problems at the intersection of hardware and AI that no one has solved before. Ex: Imagine teaching LLMs to truly understand circuit design—through schematic symbols, board layouts, spatial footprints, net connections, signal flow, and design intent.
  • Iterate quickly based on feedback from users
  • Keep our stack running smoothly (mostly AWS)

You'll thrive in this role if you:

  • Are a resourceful and self-driven engineer who knows how to figure things out and get things done.
  • Enjoy learning new things and aren’t afraid of ambiguity or messy early-stage environments.
  • Are excited about LLMs/generative AI, and using them to solve hard, impactful problems.
  • Care deeply about who use what you build more than your code
  • Be comfortable with our stack and tools: Python, PostgreSQL, LLM APIs, and ECAD software.
  • Have built real-world applications with a strong bar for quality and usability.

We’re not looking for someone who only touches one part of the stack. We value engineers who are curious, adaptable, and willing to jump in wherever needed to make the product great.

Our Hiring Process

Intro chat: A quick conversation to learn about your background, interests, and what you’re looking for. We’ll also share more about Converge Lab and what we’re building.

Technical interview (2 rounds): You’ll work on a practical, real-world problem related to our codebase. We encourage you to use AI tools and resources - this is how we actually work.
