Direct-to-consumer brands pay us, in order to market less. Well, technically, they pay us to market more effectively. And, strangely (!), that often means marketing a lot less.

How? We use a lot of math and a lot of machine learning to decide which people on their subscriber lists actually want to hear from them right now.

##  The Role

We’re looking for an exceptional Full Stack Engineer to join our product engineering team. You’ll report directly to our Director of Engineering and collaborate closely with data engineers, ML engineers, product managers and leadership teams.

Our stack is Ruby on Rails, React and PostgreSQL running on a GKE Kubernetes Cluster. If you love the idea of having a hand in everything from developing new features, designing an evolutionary architecture, design beautiful and intuitive user experiences, right along with devops and site reliability, this is a role you will thrive in. This is a critical member of our team with extremely high impact and autonomy.

###  As a full-stack engineer at Orita you will:

  • Build systems that touch 500 million records and growing every single day.

  • Build great customer facing products that help our customers leverage Orita to the greatest possible extent.

  • Move fast, with intention. We go fast, but we maintain a high level of quality and refuse to compromise on it.

  • Work at every level. You’ll build rich front end components, scalable backends, create new integrations, monitor production, allocate cloud resources, choose infrastructure, keep reliability and uptime high and everything in between.

  • Review Code, collaborate out in the open, pair and mob program, follow rigorous technical practices like TDD, and ship a LOT (On big days, we have 5+ deploys per engineer)

  • Be a builder: Start with the simplest thing and iterate a lot.

  • Be both a teacher and a student. We learn from each other every day.

  • Design, implement, test, deploy, and iterate on end-to-end features.

  • Produce clean and well-structured code with detailed specifications and documentation

  • Maintain a high bar for code quality, organization, automation, and continuous delivery

##  Your ideal background

Please apply even if you don’t meet every requirement

  • Proven experience in an engineering role, with a strong track record of delivering successful projects

  • A great track record of working in a product operating model

  • 3+ Years of Experience as a Full Stack Engineer

  • SOLID (haha) Understanding of Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Javascript, React, Playwright, SQL, Posgresql, HTML, CSS and Tailwind, but not afraid of getting your hands dirty with BigQuery, Google Cloud, GKE, Kubernetes, Docker, Object Oriented Design, Github, Github Actions and Terraform.

  • You love the front-end as much as the back-end. You like to build beautiful products and don’t shy away from CSS

  • You can set up, configure, maintain and explain front end tooling like Webpack or Vite.

  • You’ve used a cloud provider like Google, AWS or Azure

  • Strong system design fundamentals and experience building scalable systems

  • Proven software engineering skills in a production environment, including test-driven development

  • Your code is comprehensible, well-structured, and highly performant

  • Strong sense of responsibility and ownership and own projects end to end with a bias for solving problems and shipping impactful features into production that are well tested (unit & end-to-end)

  • Strong analytical and problem-solving skills

  • Intellectual curiosity. You like iterating and improving things as you go, and you’re always looking for better ways to solve hard problems.

###  Bonus Points

  • You’ve worked on a ML powered product before

  • You know how to build multiple integrations reliably.

  • Experience in the e-commerce space

  • Experience working in the e-mail or marketing tech space.

  • Early Startup Experience

  • You live in or near Columbus, OH or New York City. Most of us work in EST.

###  Where you’ll work

Remotely within the USA or Canada, with occasional in-person meetings until we get a co-working space in the future.

Our students graduate with in-demand business and AI skills—ready to launch their careers or transfer to top four-year universities. Our unique approach is grounded in a pioneering technology platform and a heavily-researched student success model that offers students dedicated advisors and on-demand tutoring and coaching. We were also named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies of 2024.

We're backed by an exceptional investor team that believes deeply in our vision for the future of education, including General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Bloomberg Beta, 8VC, Rethink Education, Sam Altman, Jason Citron, Shaquille O'Neal, and others.
