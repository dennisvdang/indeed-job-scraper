Mid-Level Role (3-5 years experience)

Well, this is not your average job ad, and we're not looking for your average engineer. Interested? Let's dig in.

1️⃣ Who we are

Our company was founded in 2006 specializing in all things technical for bus-based public transit systems in the US. This means we design, manufacture, and manage all kinds of different products and features, including driver interfaces, dispatch communications, passenger counters, announcers, GPS tracking, and reporting & data analytics. It also means we build real-time information systems for riders including apps and digital signage found at bus stops. We have relationships with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Transit app, and our work goes out to millions of riders on those platforms. Our product is like air traffic control, but for buses. There are a mix of hardware and software products in this role. We hope this excites you!  

The US-based division of the company has approximately 50 people, with 15 in the product/engineering department. It’s the best of both worlds: small company feel with big company support.  

We are fully remote with offsites once or twice a year and physical offices that some folks choose to use in Downtown LA & Houston, TX.  

2️⃣ We’re here to serve customers  

Our customers are public transit operators. Their customers are the transit riding public, which is often people who have far less than we do. Our job is to Make Transit Work for them. We take this mission very seriously, and to put it bluntly: we want engineers who are here to solve problems and serve customers as our first priority. While this isn’t an easy job and we don’t do a lot of handholding, our process is flexible and we’re interested in constantly delivering value in whatever way works best for the situation at hand.  

If you want to be challenged with growth opportunities in a small team environment with high autonomy and see your work live on thousands of transit buses nationwide, then we are the team for you.

3️⃣ We’re looking for passion  

We value engineers who like to ship solutions to problems and aren't afraid to receive direct feedback about why a particular solution may or may not be the best. We value people who enjoy being wrong and learning something new about why in the process, recognizing that the team has something to learn from everyone on it. We value people who challenge & support their peers, pressing them to be better versions of themselves and up-level the team.  

Recognizing the importance of time-to-market for our business and our users, a sense of optimism and exploration to find solutions and deliver great things with high quality is important. Whether you’re hunting through legacy code or writing our latest greenfield product, you’ll be tackling big challenges and we’re looking for people who love the excitement of delivering to the end user more than anything.  

This kind of transparency, passion, and professionalism is what makes a world-class engineering team.

4️⃣ What we need you to do in this role  

You will be contributing in a significant way to customer facing features on our system. If you take pleasure in pixel perfect UI design and thinking through UX implications while troubleshooting complex challenges, this job is for you. The role is heavily web focused to start with opportunities to gain experience across our tech stack over time.

We need someone with:

  • Strong React/web skills
  • Experience in C#
  • 3-5 years of total experience

We’re looking for someone who will grow with us for the long term

This is a mid-level engineering role that is great for someone looking for a place to take their skills to the next level. We also value interest in technology, transportation, and non-traditional, wide-ranging backgrounds.

5️⃣ Pay and Benefits

We can’t offer stock (not available from parent company), but we can offer cash comp, great benefits, and a career-making move for you.

  • $80k - $120k plus 15% bonus potential
  • Generous health and dental benefits
  • Generous paid parental leave after one year
  • 401k plan with company match
  • Flexible hours and location

Most of our work happens on Slack, but once or twice a year we get together in person to collaborate within and across our teams. Our company is a small one with great culture, and you're going to have fun being a part of it  

Our team is passionate, our product makes a difference. Let us sell you on that. We’ll show you this during the interview process, and we promise you won't be disappointed.

6️⃣ To apply, you must send more than a resume–we need to understand who you are

We don't need a formal sir or madam cover letter, but we do need to see you taking the application seriously, which means writing a note to us telling us why this job appeals to you. Include specifics about your experience in the above technologies, what your ideal team looks like, how you manage conflict, or why you believe customer-first engineering is important.  

In addition to completing the online application, the best way to get our attention is to email your note and resume to the hiring manager directly: careers-na [AT] gmv [DOT] com with the subject ""React Web Engineer."" The letter you write for us will be 10 times more valuable than your resume in getting our attention.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Pablo Durán Álvarez, in charge of this vacancy.
