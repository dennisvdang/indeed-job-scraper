Mammoth Brands (formerly Harry's Inc.) is the modern CPG company behind brands Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, and Mando. We're building a new model—and home—brands, founders, and talent looking to solve unmet needs, improve peoples' lives, and ultimately challenge the status quo. Our mission is to ""Create Things People Like More."" Simply put: everything we do should be better than what already exists. If it's not, we don't do it. This guides everything we do, from developing the best product experiences, to making Mammoth Brands a great place to work, to exploring innovative ways to give back to our community.

We got our start in 2013 when our co-founders created Harry's. We built the brand differently—online first, prioritizing direct relationships with customers—and in the process learned they'd created something bigger: a playbook and platform that could help other brands grow and scale to their full potential, and a vision to reimagine consumer packaged goods. Today, Mammoth Brands is a growing portfolio of brands and the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years. Even as we grow, we take extra care to maintain the small, scrappy, entrepreneurial culture that helped to get us where we are today: to create a company that people like more, that better serves its customers, employees, and community. As a company, we're also committed to making a positive impact and have donated over $20 million through our network of nonprofit partners to date.

Organization Overview: 

The Fortune Society, Inc. (Fortune) has been working for over 57 years in service to our mission: to support successful reentry from incarceration and promote alternatives to incarceration, thus strengthening the fabric of our communities. The organization has evolved into one of the nation’s preeminent reentry and justice-informed service organizations, providing formerly incarcerated people with the skills and wrap-around services needed to break the cycle of crime and incarceration and to build productive lives in their communities.

Each service we provide is informed by the needs of the population we serve. Fortune currently serves approximately 14,000 people a year.
