At Candid Health, we're on a mission to revolutionize healthcare by solving one of its most complex and costly problems: the billing and revenue cycle management (RCM) process. The healthcare system has long been burdened by slow, inefficient workflows that waste valuable resources, leaving providers with less time and money to focus on patient care. With our cutting-edge revenue cycle automation platform, we are transforming this space through an intelligent, data-driven approach that simplifies billing, enhances claims processing, and eliminates administrative waste.

#  The Role

As a Principal Engineer at Candid Health, you’ll play a pivotal role in our mission to revolutionize healthcare billing by guiding the technical direction of the company. As one of our most senior engineering leaders at Candid, the ideal candidate needs to have a blend of excellent technical judgment and deep engineering knowledge (in terms of both breadth and depth); we’re looking for an architect and hands-on builder who knows how to build hard things at scale and deliver massive business impact by finding the simplest solutions to our most challenging business problems.

The right candidate is also a visionary and business leader. Our archetype for a Principal Engineer at Candid is someone who understands the domain and technology so well that they can identify blind spots and therefore see huge business opportunities that others either haven’t noticed or think are too difficult to achieve. You’ll be asked to dive deep into a highly complex & nuanced problem space (medical billing), venture beyond what’s conventionally been done, and think big about how we can pioneer new approaches to improve & reinvent old systems – with the customer constantly top of mind.

Last, but certainly not least, a core function of your role will be to mentor, develop, and grow the team around you. Although this isn’t a “people manager” position per se, you will be looked up to as a technical leader, educator, evangelist, role model, and engineering culture-setter. You should inspire and empower the team to do their best work: finding scalable ways to share your knowledge and expertise across the organization, helping to clear obstacles that hinder developer productivity, and broadly maximizing the impact of our technical teams by accelerating engineering velocity and improving the quality of our eng team.

#  What You’ll Do

  • Shape Technical Direction & Business Goals: Influence technical vision and architecture of the product. Act as a technical advisor to executive leadership and cross-functional teams, influencing business strategy and product roadmap. Drive long-term business goals, ensuring that we strive for excellence and set ambitious goals while staying attuned to the reality of technical constraints. Balance technical leadership and savvy with strong business judgment to make the right decisions about technology choices.

  • Lead Architecture & Technical Execution: Functionally decompose highly complex, ambiguous problems and address them with the simplest solutions possible. Organize high level business objectives and input from cross-functional stakeholders into actionable project plans and roadmaps that are properly resourced.

  • Innovate: Identify new opportunities & untapped product areas that lead to significant business impact and/or customer outcomes. Stay up to date with the latest advancements in technology, evaluate and identify any emerging technologies or tools that could enhance our product and/or drive ROI.

  • Scale & Optimize Core Systems: Build robust systems with a clear long-term vision in mind, ensuring that our design and architecture is extensible, reliable, performant, scalable, and secure. You will work closely with leadership and cross-functional teams to tackle the most challenging technical problems, optimizing our platform’s performance and ensuring scalability and reliability across large volumes of complex healthcare data.

  • Mentor and Develop Engineering Talent: Assist in the career development of others. Help guide, mentor, and develop the next generation of software engineers on advanced technical issues. You'll share your expertise, improve engineering processes, and foster a culture of learning and excellence.

#  Who You Are

  • Bachelors or Masters of Science in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Math or other similar degree.

  • Technical qualifications:

    • 12+ years of experience building software of significant scale and complexity

    • You have achieved functional mastery of software development, systems design/architecture, and coding

    • Deep understanding of data-driven solutions and distributed systems architecture

    • You have excellent technical vision; you know the right architecture and patterns to build something of enduring value and scale

  • Leadership qualifications:

    • You have a track record of success and can provide specific examples of driving major business outcomes end to end: e.g., you personally identified a business problem or opportunity, came up with a technical solution to it, influenced leadership to prioritize the project, and drove that project through implementation to completion

    • You make the right trade-offs when considering project scope, which corners are worth cutting, and which are not.

  • Behavioral qualifications:

    • You know how to manage ambiguity and have demonstrated experience delivering results when presented with highly ambiguous business challenges

    • You have a customer-first and learner’s mindset, and value teaching others

    • You’re a clear and concise communicator; you enjoy the challenge of explaining complicated ideas in simple terms, both in-person and in writing.

    • You strive for operational excellence

  • Experience with the technologies we currently use is a plus, but by no means required: Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Metabase, Terraform, Python.

##  Pay Transparency

The estimated starting annual base salary range for this position is $238,000 to $322,000 USD. The listed range is a guideline from Pave data, and the actual base salary may be modified based on factors including job-related skills, experience/qualifications, interview performance, market data, etc. Total compensation for this position may also include equity, sales incentives (for sales roles), and employee benefits.

This role is remote anywhere in the United States

Accepting applications until 5/15/25

  • Do you enjoy working on collaborative and agile teams designing technical solutions to new problems?

  • Are you empathetic to client needs and inspired by transformation and impacting the lives of millions of people every day?

  • Are you looking to join a dynamic, inclusive team environment with a culture of belonging? 

Well, this may be the role for you. Ready to build what’s next?

Sora, an HR Workflow automation product, is empowering people-focused teams to create exceptional employee experiences. HR teams should be spending time with people, but unfortunately all facets of People teams are bogged down by managing processes instead of helping people. That’s where Sora comes in: we’re building a product that streamlines the tedious and repetitive work People teams do every day, from sending emails to assigning onboarding tasks to a new hire’s manager to syncing data across anywhere from 3 to 20 tools in a customer’s HR stack.

As a Principal Full-Stack Software Engineer, you'll be an integral part of the agile and dynamic Sora engineering team. We take a startup mindset—focused, action-oriented, and quick to execute, while always being thoughtful in our approach.

In this role, you'll collaborate with a diverse group of stakeholders, including Product Managers, Architects, DevOps Engineers, QA Engineers, and our Customer Success team. Together, you'll plan, design, develop, test, and deploy impactful solutions that cater to businesses of all sizes—from small teams to large enterprises. You’ll also engage closely with cross-functional teams across ADP, contributing throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC)—from product alignment and technical discovery to end-to-end integration and ongoing support. Success in this role requires strong collaboration, excellent communication, and deep technical expertise.

To thrive in this role, you’ll need 12+ years of experience in modern web development and cloud technologies, and substantial experience in DevOps (CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, production support). You’ll lead initiatives to build services and infrastructure for our system, improve performance, scale, and the –ilities (reliability, observability, etc), and contribute to the foundation of our engineering team. You’ll help us keep our code up-to-date with best practices, and be a champion for shipping well-tested and well-organized code. You’ll be a driver for positive change to Sora’s engineering culture, processes and technology.

As part of our team, you’ll find exciting challenges, get opportunities to grow your career, and develop solid friendships as we design what’s next for Sora, ADP, and the industry.

Mammoth Brands (formerly Harry's Inc.) is the modern CPG company behind brands Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, and Mando. We're building a new model—and home—brands, founders, and talent looking to solve unmet needs, improve peoples' lives, and ultimately challenge the status quo. Our mission is to ""Create Things People Like More."" Simply put: everything we do should be better than what already exists. If it's not, we don't do it. This guides everything we do, from developing the best product experiences, to making Mammoth Brands a great place to work, to exploring innovative ways to give back to our community.

We got our start in 2013 when our co-founders created Harry's. We built the brand differently—online first, prioritizing direct relationships with customers—and in the process learned they'd created something bigger: a playbook and platform that could help other brands grow and scale to their full potential, and a vision to reimagine consumer packaged goods. Today, Mammoth Brands is a growing portfolio of brands and the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years. Even as we grow, we take extra care to maintain the small, scrappy, entrepreneurial culture that helped to get us where we are today: to create a company that people like more, that better serves its customers, employees, and community. As a company, we're also committed to making a positive impact and have donated over $20 million through our network of nonprofit partners to date.
