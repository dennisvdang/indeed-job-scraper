NeuroFlow CEO and West Point graduate Christopher Molaro served in the army for five years, including a tour in Iraq as a platoon leader. Coming back home, he experienced firsthand the gaps in the behavioral health system and how veterans and civilians alike face too many barriers when it comes to receiving appropriate, timely care.

While pursuing his MBA at Wharton, Chris met his future co-founder Adam Pardes, and the two agreed – even the most engaging digital mental health apps in the world wouldn't truly change the problem; only a solution that systematically integrated behavioral health into the full healthcare ecosystem could create meaningful change. And so they created NeuroFlow.

What We Do:

We pride ourselves on partnering with healthcare leaders to assist in driving better outcomes, lowering total cost of care, and making behavioral health risk more predictable and transparent. NeuroFlow exists to make sure no one who needs behavioral health support falls through the cracks. 

We build more than just engaging digital health tools for self-care: we create platforms that identify population behavioral health risk early, engage individuals with acuity-specific resources, and enable care teams to make smarter and more efficient decisions. Together, NeuroFlow's solutions arm healthcare organizations with the insights they need to overcome the systemic challenges in today's healthcare ecosystem. 

How We Do It:

The award-winning culture at NeuroFlow is one built around encouragement and daring to be great. Our core values have been displayed in our office since day one, and each team member is responsible for carrying out these values and keeping each other accountable to them. We succeed through our flexibility and agility, navigating and transforming an industry ripe for change where ""no"" or ""can't"" is too often the default. NeuroFlow offers unique opportunities to work in a fun and challenging fast-paced environment with direct, meaningful impact on helping to close the divide between mental and physical health.

At NeuroFlow, a Staff Software Engineer serves as a technical authority, bringing exceptional architectural vision and leadership to transform our behavioral health technology platform. In this role, you'll define engineering standards, design scalable systems, and drive innovation that fundamentally advances healthcare delivery.

##  What You'll Do

  • Architect and implement complex distributed systems that power NeuroFlow's behavioral health platform
  • Define technical direction and engineering standards, creating roadmaps that align with long-term product vision
  • Provide technical mentorship across engineering teams, elevating overall code quality and development practices
  • Lead critical technical decisions for large-scale initiatives spanning multiple teams and systems
  • Drive cross-organizational technical strategy, working with directors and executives to shape platform capabilities

## What You Should Have

  • 8+ years of professional software engineering experience with significant full-stack development expertise
  • Deep systems design capabilities with experience architecting complex, highly-scalable distributed applications
  • Mastery of object-oriented programming with C# and advanced TypeScript skills
  • Extensive experience with .NET Framework or .NET 5+ ecosystem in production environments
  • Expert knowledge of front-end frameworks (Angular, React, or Vue) including state management patterns
  • Proven ability to design and implement large-scale service architectures and APIs
  • Advanced database design experience with performance optimization expertise
  • Experience leading technical strategy across multiple teams or projects
  • History of implementing engineering best practices and CI/CD pipelines

## Nice to Have

  • Experience scaling cloud-native applications on AWS or Azure
  • Deep knowledge of healthcare interoperability standards (HL7/FHIR)
  • Experience building secure, compliant healthcare platforms and EHR integrations
  • System design experience in high-compliance environments (HIPAA, SOC2)

## Who You Are

  • A technical visionary who excels at solving ambiguous, complex engineering challenges
  • A collaborative leader who builds consensus and elevates engineering standards
  • A strategic thinker who balances technical excellence with business objectives

## Security Requirements

  • United States Citizenship
  • Applicants selected will be subject to a security investigation and eligibility requirements for access to classified (Public Trust) information.

Company Benefits:

  • Applicable for full time employees

Flexible work schedule, unlimited PTO, physical and mental wellness benefits, medical coverage, parental leave, 401K, company-sponsored events, referral program, onsite gym, dog friendly office, snacks in the office, commuter benefits, onsite massages.
