# Indeed Job Scraper & AI Analysis [![Project Status: WIP ‚Äì Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

A Python-based data pipeline that combines web scraping and AI analysis to extract insights from job listings on Indeed.com.

Setup instructions can be found in the [Getting Started](#-getting-started) section below.

## üöÄ Project Overview

### Indeed Job Scraper

The data scraping pipeline ([indeed_scraper.py](./indeed_scraper.py)) extracts, cleans, and stores the following information:

- Job title
- Company name
- Location
- Salary information
- Indeed URL link
- Complete job descriptions

### üîç Job Description Analysis

This component is currently under development. The goal is to implement an LLM pipeline in Python to extract the following topics from the scraped job descriptions:

| Topic | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Domain/Industry | Finance, Healthcare, Ecommerce |
| Compensation | Base salary, 401K, bonuses, equity |
| Benefits | PTO, healthcare, remote work options |
| Requirements | Education level, years of experience |
| Work Arrangement | Remote, hybrid, on-site |
| Role responsibilities* | Project management, client relations, data analysis |
| Technical requirements* | Programming languages, certifications, tools |
| Technologies mentioned* | Salesforce, Python, AWS, WorkDay |

*\* These topics might be included as they are interesting from a job seeker's perspective, but are lower priority.*
